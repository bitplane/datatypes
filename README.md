# AROS image datatypes

Picture datatype classes for AROS. Each format is built, versioned and packaged separately.

## Targa

Reads colour-mapped, true-colour and grayscale TGA files, including RLE images. Saves RLE true-colour TGA: 24-bit for opaque images and 32-bit when pixels have transparency. AROS's `Devs/DataTypes/Targa` descriptor selects the class.

## PCX

Reads packed and planar indexed PCX, 8-bit indexed PCX, and 24-bit RGB PCX. Saves 24-bit RGB PCX, compositing transparency over white. AROS's `Devs/DataTypes/PCX` descriptor selects the class.

## QOI

Reads and saves QOI RGB and RGBA images. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/QOI` descriptor.
`formats/qoi/QOI.dtyp` is the compiled form of `QOI.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/qoi/QOI.dtyp formats/qoi/QOI.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## SGI

Reads SGI (IRIS) images, verbatim or RLE, with 8 or 16 bits per channel: grayscale, gray with alpha, RGB and RGBA. 16-bit channels keep their top byte, and channels beyond the fourth are ignored. Also reads the obsolete dithered (3-3-2 RGB) images, and screen images as grayscale, since their palette isn't stored in the file. Saves 8-bit RLE: grayscale when every pixel is gray, RGB otherwise, and RGBA when pixels have transparency.
The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/SGI` descriptor, which matches the `01 DA` magic on files named `.rgb`, `.rgba`, `.bw`, `.sgi`, `.int` or `.inta`. `formats/sgi/SGI.dtyp` is the compiled form of `SGI.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/sgi/SGI.dtyp formats/sgi/SGI.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## WBMP

Reads type 0 WBMP (WAP bitmap), the 1-bit black and white format. Saves type 0 WBMP: pixels are composited over white, then set white if their luminance is at least half. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/WBMP` descriptor. WBMP has no magic number, so the descriptor matches the two leading zero bytes and requires a `.wbmp` name, at priority -10.
`formats/wbmp/WBMP.dtyp` is the compiled form of `WBMP.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/wbmp/WBMP.dtyp formats/wbmp/WBMP.dtd` if the recognition rules change.
## Sun Raster

Reads 1-bit, 8-bit, 24-bit and 32-bit Sun Raster files in old, standard, RLE and RGB types, with or without an RGB colormap. 1-bit images without a colormap are black on white and 8-bit ones are grayscale. The pad byte of 32-bit pixels is ignored, so images load opaque. Saves uncompressed 24-bit Sun Raster, compositing transparency over white. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/SUNRASTER` descriptor, which recognises files by their magic number whatever their name.
`formats/sunraster/SUNRASTER.dtyp` is the compiled form of `SUNRASTER.dtd`; regenerate it with `createdtdesc -o formats/sunraster/SUNRASTER.dtyp formats/sunraster/SUNRASTER.dtd`. `createdtdesc` also builds on the host from AROS's `tools/dtdesc`.

## XBM

Reads X11 bitmaps (`char` arrays) and older X10 bitmaps (`short` arrays), accepting what Xlib's `XReadBitmapFile` accepts: comments, other preprocessor lines, decimal or negative values, and names that don't share a prefix. Images load as one-plane pictures, with set bits in black on an opaque white background. A hotspot becomes the picture's grab point. Saves X11 bitmaps: dark pixels (by luminance, after compositing over white) become set bits, the C names come from the file name being written, and a non-zero grab point is written as the hotspot. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/XBM` descriptor, which matches files named `#?.xbm`, because XBM files have no fixed header to look for.
`formats/xbm/XBM.dtyp` is the compiled form of `XBM.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/xbm/XBM.dtyp formats/xbm/XBM.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## Farbfeld

Reads Farbfeld images: 16-bit big-endian RGBA with straight alpha. Channels are rounded to the nearest 8-bit value, and an image whose alpha is zero everywhere loads opaque. Bytes after the last pixel are ignored. Saves Farbfeld with each 8-bit channel widened exactly (times 257), so a saved image loads back unchanged. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/FARBFELD` descriptor, which recognises files by their `farbfeld` magic whatever their name.
`formats/farbfeld/FARBFELD.dtyp` is the compiled form of `FARBFELD.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/farbfeld/FARBFELD.dtyp formats/farbfeld/FARBFELD.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## DDS

Reads DirectDraw Surface textures. Block-compressed images can be DXT1, DXT3 or DXT5 (BC1 to BC3), ATI1/BC4U (BC4, shown gray), or ATI2, BC5U and BC5S (BC5: red and green, with blue 0; signed values show as v + 128 with blue 128). DX10 headers add BC1 to BC5, BC6H and BC7. Uncompressed images can use any 8 to 32-bit RGB, luminance or alpha-only layout described by bit masks, 8-bit palettes, or the DX10 formats R8G8B8A8, B8G8R8A8, B8G8R8X8 and R10G10B10A2. BC6H is HDR: values are clamped to 0-1 and encoded with the sRGB curve. DXT1 blocks can be transparent. Alpha in other uncompressed formats and palettes counts only when the header declares it. DX10 premultiplied alpha is converted to straight alpha, and DX10's opaque alpha mode is honoured. Declared alpha is preserved even when it is zero everywhere.

Mip levels, cube faces, array slices and volume slices are separate pictures, counted in file order: each face or slice in turn, then its mip levels from largest to smallest. Without `PDTA_WhichPicture` the first one loads. Levels missing from the end of a file aren't counted. A file whose first picture is cut short fails to load. Each picture can have at most 16M pixels.

Not supported: DXT2 and DXT4 (premultiplied DXT3 and DXT5), BC4 signed, RXGB, YUV formats, the float and 16-bit-per-channel D3D formats, and DX10 formats other than those above, including the `_SRGB` codes of BC1 to BC3 and B8G8R8A8. Neither ImageMagick nor Pillow reads these.

Saves uncompressed DDS with one image and no mip levels: 24-bit RGB when every pixel is opaque, 32-bit ARGB otherwise.
The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/DDS` descriptor, which matches the `DDS ` magic and the 124-byte header size on files named `#?.dds`. `formats/dds/DDS.dtyp` is the compiled form of `DDS.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/dds/DDS.dtyp formats/dds/DDS.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## Build and test

```sh
make test
make build TARGET=x86_64-aros PACKAGE=targa
```

Each module is written to `dist/<target>/<package>.datatype` and installs at `Classes/DataTypes/<package>.datatype`.

## Versions

Each datatype has its own two-number module and package version. Release tags identify one format, for example `targa-1.0`; changes to another format do not change Targa's version.
