# AROS image datatypes

Picture datatype classes for AROS. Each format is built, versioned and packaged separately.

## Targa

Reads colour-mapped, true-colour and grayscale TGA files, including RLE images. Saves RLE true-colour TGA: 24-bit for opaque images and 32-bit when pixels have transparency. AROS's `Devs/DataTypes/Targa` descriptor selects the class.

## PCX

Reads packed and planar indexed PCX, 8-bit indexed PCX, and 24-bit RGB PCX. Saves 24-bit RGB PCX, compositing transparency over white. AROS's `Devs/DataTypes/PCX` descriptor selects the class.

## QOI

Reads and saves QOI RGB and RGBA images. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/QOI` descriptor.
`formats/qoi/QOI.dtyp` is the compiled form of `QOI.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/qoi/QOI.dtyp formats/qoi/QOI.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## SGI

Reads SGI (IRIS) images, verbatim or RLE, with 8 or 16 bits per channel: grayscale, gray with alpha, RGB and RGBA. 16-bit channels keep their top byte, and channels beyond the fourth are ignored. Also reads the obsolete dithered (3-3-2 RGB) images, and screen images as grayscale, since their palette isn't stored in the file. Saves 8-bit RLE: grayscale when every pixel is gray, RGB otherwise, and RGBA when pixels have transparency.
The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/SGI` descriptor, which matches the `01 DA` magic on files named `.rgb`, `.rgba`, `.bw`, `.sgi`, `.int` or `.inta`. `formats/sgi/SGI.dtyp` is the compiled form of `SGI.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/sgi/SGI.dtyp formats/sgi/SGI.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## WBMP

Reads type 0 WBMP (WAP bitmap), the 1-bit black and white format. Saves type 0 WBMP: pixels are composited over white, then set white if their luminance is at least half. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/WBMP` descriptor. WBMP has no magic number, so the descriptor matches the two leading zero bytes and requires a `.wbmp` name, at priority -10.
`formats/wbmp/WBMP.dtyp` is the compiled form of `WBMP.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/wbmp/WBMP.dtyp formats/wbmp/WBMP.dtd` if the recognition rules change.
## Sun Raster

Reads 1-bit, 8-bit, 24-bit and 32-bit Sun Raster files in old, standard, RLE and RGB types, with or without an RGB colormap. 1-bit images without a colormap are black on white and 8-bit ones are grayscale. The pad byte of 32-bit pixels is ignored, so images load opaque. Saves uncompressed 24-bit Sun Raster, compositing transparency over white. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/SUNRASTER` descriptor, which recognises files by their magic number whatever their name.
`formats/sunraster/SUNRASTER.dtyp` is the compiled form of `SUNRASTER.dtd`; regenerate it with `createdtdesc -o formats/sunraster/SUNRASTER.dtyp formats/sunraster/SUNRASTER.dtd`. `createdtdesc` also builds on the host from AROS's `tools/dtdesc`.

## XBM

Reads X11 bitmaps (`char` arrays) and older X10 bitmaps (`short` arrays), accepting what Xlib's `XReadBitmapFile` accepts: comments, other preprocessor lines, decimal or negative values, and names that don't share a prefix. Images load as one-plane pictures, with set bits in black on an opaque white background. A hotspot becomes the picture's grab point. Saves X11 bitmaps: dark pixels (by luminance, after compositing over white) become set bits, the C names come from the file name being written, and a non-zero grab point is written as the hotspot. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/XBM` descriptor, which matches files named `#?.xbm`, because XBM files have no fixed header to look for.
`formats/xbm/XBM.dtyp` is the compiled form of `XBM.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/xbm/XBM.dtyp formats/xbm/XBM.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## Farbfeld

Reads Farbfeld images: 16-bit big-endian RGBA with straight alpha. Channels are rounded to the nearest 8-bit value, including images whose alpha is zero everywhere. Bytes after the last pixel are ignored. Saves Farbfeld with each 8-bit channel widened exactly (times 257), so a saved image loads back unchanged. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/FARBFELD` descriptor, which recognises files by their `farbfeld` magic whatever their name.
`formats/farbfeld/FARBFELD.dtyp` is the compiled form of `FARBFELD.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/farbfeld/FARBFELD.dtyp formats/farbfeld/FARBFELD.dtd` if the recognition rules change.
## MacPaint

Reads MacPaint files, versions 0, 2 and 3, with or without a 128-byte MacBinary header in front, as 576×720 one-plane pictures in black on white. The version field and pattern table are ignored, as are padding and resource forks after the image. PackBits runs may cross rows, a `0x80` flag byte repeats the next byte 129 times as ImageMagick and netpbm read it, and a run past the last pixel is clipped. Files that end before the last row are rejected. Saves version 0 MacPaint with each row packed on its own: dark pixels (by luminance, after compositing over white) become black, smaller pictures are padded with white, and larger ones keep only their top-left 576×720. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/MACPAINT` descriptor. MacPaint has no magic number, so the descriptor matches the leading zero byte that both plain and MacBinary files start with, and requires a `#?.(mac|macp|pntg|pnt)` name, at priority -10. MacBinary files named `.bin` aren't recognised.
`formats/macpaint/MACPAINT.dtyp` is the compiled form of `MACPAINT.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/macpaint/MACPAINT.dtyp formats/macpaint/MACPAINT.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## Build and test

```sh
make test
make build TARGET=x86_64-aros PACKAGE=targa
```

Each module is written to `dist/<target>/<package>.datatype` and installs at `Classes/DataTypes/<package>.datatype`.

## Versions

Each datatype has its own two-number module and package version. Release tags identify one format, for example `targa-1.0`; changes to another format do not change Targa's version.
