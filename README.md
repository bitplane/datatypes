# AROS image datatypes

Picture datatype classes for AROS. Each format is built, versioned and packaged separately.

## Targa

Reads colour-mapped, true-colour and grayscale TGA files, including RLE images. Saves RLE true-colour TGA: 24-bit for opaque images and 32-bit when pixels have transparency. AROS's `Devs/DataTypes/Targa` descriptor selects the class.

## PCX

Reads packed and planar indexed PCX, 8-bit indexed PCX, and 24-bit RGB PCX. Saves 24-bit RGB PCX, compositing transparency over white. AROS's `Devs/DataTypes/PCX` descriptor selects the class.

## QOI

Reads and saves QOI RGB and RGBA images. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/QOI` descriptor.
`formats/qoi/QOI.dtyp` is the compiled form of `QOI.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/qoi/QOI.dtyp formats/qoi/QOI.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## SGI

Reads SGI (IRIS) images, verbatim or RLE, with 8 or 16 bits per channel: grayscale, gray with alpha, RGB and RGBA. 16-bit channels keep their top byte, and channels beyond the fourth are ignored. Also reads the obsolete dithered (3-3-2 RGB) images, and screen images as grayscale, since their palette isn't stored in the file. Saves 8-bit RLE: grayscale when every pixel is gray, RGB otherwise, and RGBA when pixels have transparency.
The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/SGI` descriptor, which matches the `01 DA` magic on files named `.rgb`, `.rgba`, `.bw`, `.sgi`, `.int` or `.inta`. `formats/sgi/SGI.dtyp` is the compiled form of `SGI.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/sgi/SGI.dtyp formats/sgi/SGI.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## WBMP

Reads type 0 WBMP (WAP bitmap), the 1-bit black and white format. Saves type 0 WBMP: pixels are composited over white, then set white if their luminance is at least half. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/WBMP` descriptor. WBMP has no magic number, so the descriptor matches the two leading zero bytes and requires a `.wbmp` name, at priority -10.
`formats/wbmp/WBMP.dtyp` is the compiled form of `WBMP.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/wbmp/WBMP.dtyp formats/wbmp/WBMP.dtd` if the recognition rules change.
## Sun Raster

Reads 1-bit, 8-bit, 24-bit and 32-bit Sun Raster files in old, standard, RLE and RGB types, with or without an RGB colormap. 1-bit images without a colormap are black on white and 8-bit ones are grayscale. The pad byte of 32-bit pixels is ignored, so images load opaque. Saves uncompressed 24-bit Sun Raster, compositing transparency over white. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/SUNRASTER` descriptor, which recognises files by their magic number whatever their name.
`formats/sunraster/SUNRASTER.dtyp` is the compiled form of `SUNRASTER.dtd`; regenerate it with `createdtdesc -o formats/sunraster/SUNRASTER.dtyp formats/sunraster/SUNRASTER.dtd`. `createdtdesc` also builds on the host from AROS's `tools/dtdesc`.

## XBM

Reads X11 bitmaps (`char` arrays) and older X10 bitmaps (`short` arrays), accepting what Xlib's `XReadBitmapFile` accepts: comments, other preprocessor lines, decimal or negative values, and names that don't share a prefix. Images load as one-plane pictures, with set bits in black on an opaque white background. A hotspot becomes the picture's grab point. Saves X11 bitmaps: dark pixels (by luminance, after compositing over white) become set bits, the C names come from the file name being written, and a non-zero grab point is written as the hotspot. The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/XBM` descriptor, which matches files named `#?.xbm`, because XBM files have no fixed header to look for.
`formats/xbm/XBM.dtyp` is the compiled form of `XBM.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/xbm/XBM.dtyp formats/xbm/XBM.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## PAM and PFM

Reads Netpbm PAM (`P7`) and the float maps PFM (`PF` colour, `Pf` gray, `PF4` RGBA) and PHM (`PH`, `Ph`, half floats). PAM covers the tuple types `BLACKANDWHITE`, `GRAYSCALE`, `RGB` and `CMYK`, each with or without `_ALPHA`, at any maxval up to 65535. Samples scale to 8 bits with netpbm's rounding, and values above maxval are clamped. Without a known tuple type, one or two planes load as gray and three or more as RGB. Alpha is only used when the tuple type declares it, including alpha that is zero everywhere. Float maps are linear light: samples are clamped to 0–1 and encoded with the sRGB curve, and alpha is kept linear. The sign of the scale gives the byte order. Its size is ignored. A file can hold several images, one after another (PAM and float maps may be mixed). `PDTA_WhichPicture` picks one, and `PDTA_GetNumPictures` reports how many there are. Saves 8-bit PAM as `GRAYSCALE` when every pixel is gray and `RGB` otherwise, adding alpha (`_ALPHA`) when pixels have transparency.
Not supported: PNM images (`P1`–`P6`, left to AROS's `pnm` class, including inside a PAM stream), XV thumbnails (`P7 332`), and float map headers with comments or CRLF line ends, which the reference tools also reject or misread.
The package includes its `Devs/DataTypes/PAM` descriptor. It matches `P` followed by two bytes, at priority -1, so AROS's PNM descriptors (priority 0) still take `P1`–`P6`. This also recognises `PF4`; unrelated matches are rejected by the decoder. `formats/pam/PAM.dtyp` is the compiled form of `PAM.dtd`; regenerate it with AROS's `createdtdesc -o formats/pam/PAM.dtyp formats/pam/PAM.dtd` if the recognition rules change.

## Build and test

```sh
make test
make build TARGET=x86_64-aros PACKAGE=targa
```

Each module is written to `dist/<target>/<package>.datatype` and installs at `Classes/DataTypes/<package>.datatype`.

## Versions

Each datatype has its own two-number module and package version. Release tags identify one format, for example `targa-1.0`; changes to another format do not change Targa's version.
